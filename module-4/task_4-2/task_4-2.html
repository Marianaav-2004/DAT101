      <li>[1. What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[It is a data structure in the program that stores multiple values, 
        but in a single variable, and this being extracted from the index]</p>

      <li>[2. What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? ]</li>
      <p>[It means that we write down directly the fixed values into the code, 
        instead of having to get them from variables or from the html and so on.]</p>

      <li>[3. Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we 
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[It goes one by one analysnig it to see the task to be performed. and when we 
        dont know how long it is, we use a loop to check the arrays length, and this one 
        going on and on again until it finishes the indicated loop or elements.]</p>

      <li>[4. Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[Its beneficial since it helps manage the objects easier and stayed organized in one place 
        making it easier to add, remove and so on objects from the code.]</p>

      <li>[5. Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for 
        example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
        wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and 
        "Thursday", how would it ideally look? ]</li>
      <p>[this is used in order to organize and store the weekdays in a more structured and organized 
        way, making it easier to manage. as well as it helps keeping everything constant and easy to read 
        the code. The value object has the specific data, like the name of the day, helping in the process 
        of like looping through the days. For me, weekdays is the single day, workdays are working days, and weekends 
        is the end of the week like non-working days. this helps divide the code into different groups 
        with different purposes and keeps it cleaner and more structured and organized. ]</p>

      <li>[6. In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.]</li>
      <p>[A callback is a function that can pass an argument to another different function, 
        whenever this one is needed. This one can also help when deciding when two elements are being compared.  ]</p>

      <li>[7. What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out 
        if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print 
        both parameters each time the sorting routine runs]</li>
      <p>[Here the array is comparing two elements that are shown at the time and trying 
        to decide the order. This being done with the help of the callback function. Such as returning to a number 
        and seeing the order if it should come second or first. ]</p>

      <li>[8. In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains]</li>
      <p>[The first element that i included was the array with the first row of the table, 
        and then other arrays with the columns that are to be organized. ]</p>
