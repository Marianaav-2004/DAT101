      <li>[1. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Object oriented development is important since this helps organize and have the code 
        in a more manageable, clean and organized way, making it easier to understand]</p>

      <li>[2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and 
        how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[It is used to organize and store different type of account with a fixed and specific 
        value in them, keeping all of them in one place and preventing mistakes, along
        with making the code easier to understand]</p>

      <li>[3.  Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? 
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[We do this in order to protect the data and keep it hidden meaning that only we have access 
        to it, making it safer and preventing others to come in and modify the code. As well as it 
        can be safer. We create private members by using let and const, and public by using this.]</p>

      <li>[4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.]</li>
      <p>[It creates a new object from a constructor function, as a kind of empty object, 
        which can also help create multiple object with this one already used structure.]</p>
