      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				If there is a constants then it can not be changed, but if you use let then it is possible to change the variables. Therefore u can use indeed constants all around, but it is easier if u also just use let since there can be changed later on. 
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				This affect since the operations inside are calculated first, and this ones can change the outcome of how it comes. 
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can limit them by different options, this makes it more precise and accurate to the program. 
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				This ones can be compared, and this can be taken into the system as equal since they are close to each other, but of course there is also the possibility to make it into it not being registered like that. 
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				These ones help with the Boolean, since this one gives the true and false answers to the coding being set. And these ones are just taken by making that comparison in the system. 
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				This one give u a random number between 0 to 1, and this one can mainly be used to generate a random number, or create an unpredictable in the program. 
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				Modulus gives the remainder after dividing one number by the other one. And this one can be used when there is more importance into the remainder instead of the division itself since that is the one we are trying to pay more attention to.
