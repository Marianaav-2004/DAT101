      <li>[1. What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?]</li>
      <p>[Creating a function means that it is telling or defining what the function 
        is going to be doing. And invoking a function is actually making the function 
        run and function and using it. ]</p> 

      <li>[2. Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.]</li>
      <p>[Semicolons are used to indicate the end of a statement in the line of code. 
        A code blocks are written using the {} this ones and can group multiple statements
        together in one of this ones, like inside. ]</p>

      <li>[3. What happens when we try to store values from a function when it 
        doesn't return any?]</li>
      <p>[If the function does not return a value it will turn into the answer 
        as undefined, since there is nothing to return to. ]</p>

      <li>[4. How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?]</li>
      <p>[Parameters are separated by commas. ]</p>

      <li>[5. Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation 
        and creation of a function.]</li>
      <p>[When you create a function you have to give name to the parameters that will 
        be used later on. So when invoking a function we pass this values which are the 
        arguments to the function.]</p>

      <li>[6. Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call 
        is missing a parameter.]</li>
      <p>[A parameter will be undefined if a function is missing a parameter 
        since it has not been set to a value to be used or passed down.]</p>

      <li>[7. Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.]</li>
      <p>[When using a recursive function it will be coming back and being called 
        again and again until the function solves itself or solves what it is 
        being asked to. Kind of like asking itself to solve the problem.]</p>
