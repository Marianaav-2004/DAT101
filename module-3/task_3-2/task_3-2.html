      <li>[In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?]</li>
      <p>[Yes if u take it out from an index, yet it is easier if u also use two loops]</p>

      <li>[In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop? Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of your answer]</li>
      <p>[Yes you can, you can make an infinite loop with the "while" condition as long as u are implementing that it is checked through with true. For instance as seen 
        in the code, this one contains as well == meaning that the code will be checked even better when running. ]</p>

      <li>[Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can the program perform other tasks concurrently?]</li>
      <p>[A system for a computer can technically run fast, also depending on how many checks in the code you add, along with the number of random you are asking it to 
        take into account when printing out. And this one is happening as the program is running, yet one thing at the time. Meaning that while a "while" loop is running, 
        the system is not executing anything more. ]</p>

      <li>[Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance, change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?]</li>
      <p>[The relationship between these ones can be seen as how this ones are described into the loops with a grid, with inner and outer loops, one being columns and the 
        other one rows. You can change the order, this will just change the order of the elements that you have set into the code. This will also obviously depend on 
        where you want the information to be ordered. ]</p>
