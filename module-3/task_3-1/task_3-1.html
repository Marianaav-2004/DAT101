      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake up time is not 7, thanks to the use of if and setting up the value of when it is exactly 7 she can take the bus, so therefore when getting 
        an if there is a confirmation that 7 will give the bus result, yet without the wake-up time is not 7 this one and we try to run it at 6 or any other number 
        this doesn't give the desired result and comes off as fail]</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[Well technically for answering towards when it is exactly 7 there was the use of the previous code section from waking up at exactly 7, yet we added an if in 
        order to indicate that that is an option per say, yet with the help of else this one indicates this one has to take the car to school, making it easier to 
        indicate that else will happen if if doesn't come thru, being that she doesn't wake up at 7]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[]</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
